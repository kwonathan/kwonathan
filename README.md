### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm John, a DPhil candidate at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), as part of the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/).
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on neural speech decoding, supervised by Dr Oiwi Parker Jones at [PNPL](https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/homepage/) within the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my current and past projects, switching to computer science, or anything else.
- ðŸ“« Shoot me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-teyun-kwon/) to get in touch!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I studied Latin and Ancient Greek for my undergraduate degree. (And thoroughly enjoyed both!)
